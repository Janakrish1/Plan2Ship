  "rawDocument": "I. Strategic Identity ● Feature Name: PNC Refund Radar ● Product Pillar: Virtual Wallet / Cash Flow Management ● Target Persona: High-frequency online shoppers (Gen Z/Millennials) who utilize 'Buy Now, Pay Later' or return items frequently. ● The 'Magic Moment': Receiving a notification the moment a merchant initiates a refund, even before the money hits the ledger, so the user knows they 'won' the dispute or return. II. The Problem Space (Deep Dive) ● The Micro-Friction Event: A user returns a $200 jacket to a retailer. They check their transaction history daily for 7 days. Because the refund date often differs from the return date, they have to scroll back through weeks of data to see if the credit arrived. ● Data Blind Spots: Users cannot see the difference between a 'Pending Credit' and a 'Settled Credit.' They also don't know if a partial refund (e.g., $180 vs $200) is due to a restocking fee or a bank error. ● Psychological Hurdle: 'Financial Limbo.' The user feels they have $200 'missing' in the world, which prevents them from making other necessary purchases, leading to a feeling of being out of control. ● Existing Workarounds: Users keep screenshots of return receipts or keep 'Return' emails marked as unread in their inbox until they manually verify the credit in the PNC app. ● The Cost of Inaction: High volume of 'Where is my money?' calls to PNC support; customers perceiving the bank as 'slow' even when the delay is on the merchant’s end. III. Strategic Constraints & Inputs ● Integrations: Must pull data from ISO 8583 transaction messaging (specifically looking for 'Credit' indicators) and integrate with the Virtual Wallet 'Calendar' view. ● The 'North Star' Policy: Must adhere to Reg E (Electronic Fund Transfers) regarding the timing of when credits must be made available to the customer. ● The 'Do-Not-Touch' List: The feature should NOT allow the user to spend the refund until the funds are officially settled/cleared, to avoid overdraft risk if the merchant reverses the credit.",
  "summary": "The product solves refund uncertainty by providing early refund initiation notifications, distinguishing pending from settled credits, and offering contextual explanations for discrepancies. It targets Gen Z and Millennial online shoppers and BNPL users who experience frequent returns and financial uncertainty. The feature aligns with PNC’s goals to improve transparency, reduce support inquiries, enhance Virtual Wallet, and maintain regulatory compliance while differentiating PNC through proactive refund visibility.",
